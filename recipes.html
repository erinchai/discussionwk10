            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

                <li>Unsalted butter</li>

                <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat well</li>
                <li>Add the melted chocolate</li>

            <h2>Chicken Curry</h2>
            <p>Origin: Japan</p>
            <p>Source: Family Recipe</p>
            <p>Category: Main Dish</p> 
            <img src="images/JapaneseChickenCurry.jpg" width ="200" alt = "Japanese Chicken Curry">
            <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. It’s an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
                <li>1 can peas</li>
                <li>5 new potatoes, halved</li>
                <li>1 package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.</li>

            <h2>Homemade Mac & Cheese</h2>
            <p>Origin: Northern Europe</p>

            <img src="images/mac&cheese.jpg" width ="200" alt = "Mac and Cheese">
            <p>Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food staple that has captured the hearts of people all over the world. Originating from Europe and popularized in the United States, this dish consists of elbow macaroni pasta smothered in a creamy cheese sauce. The simplicity of its ingredients—pasta, cheese, and often a touch of butter or milk—belies a rich, complex flavor that has made it a favorite for both quick weeknight dinners and festive holiday gatherings.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Macaroni</li>
                <li>Butter and flour</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Seasonings</li>
                <li>Bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle flour over and cook, stirring, until slightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until combined. Add mustard powder; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup Parmesan until melted and smooth. Stir in macaroni and transfer to the prepared dish.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine panko, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Sprinkle over macaroni; season with more pepper.</li>
                <li>Bake mac and cheese until bubbly and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
